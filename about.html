I'm not a coding genius, just an average guy who can figure out how to do some basic web stuff. In fact, I had some help building this site since my previous website looked pretty bad and was very low effort.</p> <p>I live in the US, up in the high mountains, with both of my parents. These days, I spend a lot of time playing Beat Saber and uploading some of my gameplay to YouTube. My current setup is a Quest 3 VR headset connected to a PC with an RX 6650 XT GPU and an i5-11600K CPU.</p> <p>As for personal details, I prefer to keep my age, height, race, and physical appearance private due to the nature of the internet. I'm bilingual, speaking both English and Spanish, and I'm currently trying to improve my Spanish skills even further.</p>
