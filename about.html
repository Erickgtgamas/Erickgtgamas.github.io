    Hey Im Erickgtgamas (or Erick)
    <br><br>
I made this website because I was bored and figured, why not? I'm not a coding genius, just an average guy who can figure out how to do some basic web stuff. 
    <br><br>
In fact, I had some "help" building this site since my previous website looked pretty bad and was very low effort.
   
    <br><br>
I live in the US, up in the high mountains, with both of my parents. These days, I spend a lot of time playing Beat Saber and uploading some of my gameplay to YouTube.
    <br><br>
My current setup is a Quest 3 VR headset connected to a PC with an RX 6650 XT GPU and an i5-11600K CPU.

    <br><br>
As for personal details, I prefer to keep my age, height, race, and physical appearance private due to the nature of the internet. 
<br>
<br>
I'm bilingual, speaking both English and Spanish, and I'm currently trying to improve my Spanish skills even further.
